# List all files in a directory
Basically the dir command (or ls in linux) but saves the contents of the folder to a text file.

Instead of using the system header, I thought I should try and make something that lists all of the contents of the folder myself. This is quite easy in hindseight but was a challence at the time since I was new to C.

I originally made this so I could quickly save the contents of any folder for when I was fixing a computer for someone.
